        "\n",
        "**Docker Engine is an open-source containerization technology for building and containerizing applications. To build and manage Docker containers, the user needs kernel-level access and full control of system resources. Full control is necessary because Docker relies on Linux kernel features such as Control Groups (cgroups) and Namespaces to create and manage containers.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **cgroups provide a mechanism in Linux for managing system resources. cgroups enable fine-grained control of resources such as CPU, memory, block I/O, and network bandwidth for Linux containers. Docker uses cgroups to allocate resources to containers, ensuring that each container operates within its defined resource limits without negatively impacting other containers or processes on the host system.**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Namespaces are used to isolate parts of the operating system. When a Docker container is started, the Docker engine instructs the kernel to create namespaces for the container. These namespaces ensure that different aspects of the container, such as networking, file systems, and process IDs (PIDs), are restricted to the container’s isolated environment. As a result, processes and resources inside one container are not visible to others, nor to the host system, unless explicitly shared. This isolation can be configured to allow certain shared resources or interactions, but by default, namespaces provide strong separation.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**In the current Google Colab environment, users cannot configure or edit cgroups or Namespaces. This restriction exists because Google Colab runs in a shared environment where users do not have kernel-level privileges. Without control over these features, it is not possible to create or run Docker containers. As of October 2024, Google Colab does not support running Docker Engine. In the future, changes to Colab’s environment might allow users to run containers, but for now, these features remain unavailable.**"

Unlike Docker, which relies on kernel-level features such as namespaces and cgroups for isolation and resource management, udocker simulates root privileges using user namespaces and ptrace system calls via PRoot or Fakechroot.
