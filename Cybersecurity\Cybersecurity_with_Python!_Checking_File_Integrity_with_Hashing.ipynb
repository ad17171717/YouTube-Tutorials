For example the SHA-256 hash output is always 256 bits (32 bytes), regardless of the input size. Internally, SHA-256 processes data in 512-bit blocks, applying a series of transformations. The block size refers to the size of chunks the hashing function processes at a time, before applying compression functions in its internal rounds. If the data is larger than the block size, it is split into multiple parts before being hashed. If it is smaller than the algorithm will pad the data with binary numbers (0 and 1s) until it is the same size as the block size. The SHA256 Algorithm has a block size of 512 bits. The final column indicates if there is a known collision for an algorithm. A collision is when two different inputs generate the same output for a hashing algorithm. Algorithms with known collisions are insecure because digital signatures can be faked with an insecure algorithm.**"
