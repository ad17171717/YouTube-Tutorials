    "\n",
    "**The Infinite Monkey Theorem outlines a scenario where a monkey, given infinite time, will randomly type and reproduce any written text `almost surely`. For example a monkey will eventually randomly write the works of William Shakespeare given an infinite period of time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The basis of the theorem lies in Probability Theory. An event labeled as `almost surely` to happen means it will happen with a probability of 1 given an infinite number of trials. If the number of trials is finite, then the outcome that a monkey will write a Shakespeare work is no longer guaranteed and the probability is less than or equal to 1.** "

    "## **Mathematical Proof**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. We assume that the keyboard has 26 keys represented by $\\large{k}$. There is an equal probability that the monkey will type any of the characters on the keyboard $\\large{\\frac{1}{k}}$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. For a single trial the probability of typing the target text $\\large{T}$ depends on the numbers of keys in the keyboard $\\large{k}$ and the number of characters in the text $\\large{n}$: $\\large{P(T)=(\\frac{1}{k})^n=\\frac{1}{k^n}}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. A successful outcome where the monkey correctly writes the text starting at the $\\large{i}$ th character is represented by $\\large{A_i}$. The probability of a successful event is given by $\\large{P(A_i)=\\frac{1}{k^n}}$. Since the trials are independent the joint probability of typing the text correctly in multiple independent trials is the product of individual probabilities: $\\large{P(A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cdots \\cap A_n) = P(A_1)\\cdot P(A_2) \\cdot \\ \\cdots \\ \\cdot P(A_n)}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Given an infinite series of keystrokes the probability that the text will be typed at least once is given by: $\\large{P(\\bigcup^{\\infty}_{i=1}A_i)}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Using the [Second Borel-Cantelli Lemma](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Second_Borel-Cantelli_Lemma) we can show if the trials are infinite, $\\large{\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}P(A_i)=\\infty}$, and the events $\\large{A_i}$ are independent, then the probability that the text is typed by the monkey is almost surely $\\large{1}$: $\\large{P\\left( \\limsup\\limits_{i \\to \\infty} A_i \\right) = 1}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. The probability of typing the text $\\large{T}$ in any specific block of $\\large{n}$ characters is given by: $\\large{P(T) = \\frac{1}{k^n}}$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Since there are infinitely many independent trials, the sum of the probabilities of all such events is: $\\large{\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} P(A_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k^n} = \\infty}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**This means that with infinite trials, the probability that the text will be typed at least once is 1, which guarantees that the text will be typed `almost surely`.**"

    "### **Finding the Number of Iterations Needed to Randomly Choose the Letters for a Target Words**\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will first create a function that estimates the number of iterations we need to randomly choose a target word. We can do this by taking the number of keys on a keyboard $\\large{k}$ and raising it by the number of keys by the length of the characters in a target word $\\large{n}$. This gives us $\\large{k^n}$. For this to be applicable we need to make the assumptions listed below.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The number of keys within our keyboard is a finite set of characters. In this tutorail we are limiting the keys to the lowercase version of the English alphabet: $\\large{\\Sigma = {a,b,...,z}}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The total number of keys is represented by $k$: $\\large{|\\Sigma|=k=26}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The keystrokes that are selected need to be independent from each other. This means that if the letter `t` is typed, it will not affect the selection of the next letter. In our notation $P$ stands for the probability of selecting a certain key, $X_i$ is a random variable representing the first potential character at the $i$th key stroke and $x_i$ is the realized character at the $i$th key stroke.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large{P(X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,...,X_n=x_n) = P(X_1=x_1) \\cdot P(X_2=x_2) \\cdot \\ ... \\ \\cdot P(X_n=x_n)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The selection of a character needs to be uniform and randomly selected. The probability of selecting a specific character $\\large{c}$ in the set of characters $\\large{\\Sigma}$ for a given keystroke can be represented as: $\\large{P(X_i=c)=\\frac{1}{k}}$**"
